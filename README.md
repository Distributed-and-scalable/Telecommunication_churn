## Executive Summary
"Predict behavior to retain customers. [IBM Sample Data Sets] If you have a look at American Statista report for customer churn, it says- the industry in the United States where customers were most likely to leave their current provider due to poor customer service appears to be cable television, with a 25 percent churn rate in 2020.
Customer churn rate is defined by the number of customers lost during a period (month, quarter, or year) compared to the number of customers you had at the beginning of that period. If you lose 5% of your customers each month, it will mean you have a 50% annual churn rate. And in terms of revenue, you are looking at a 25–30% divergence in revenue.

## Introduction

Customer churn is a fundamental problem for the telecommunication (Telco) industry. It is defined as the loss of customers moved from one Telco operator to another. If customer churn can be predicted in advance, such as “is this customer going to leave us within the next X months?”, Telco operators can apply business marketing policies to such churn customers to retain and increase the customer base. In particular, given millions of Telco customers, even reducing the 1% churn rate will lead to a significant profit increase.
We can roughly define the Churn analysis as the whole of analytical studies on “a customer”, “a product or service”, and “the probability of abandonment”. We aim to be aware of this situation (even the customer himself may not be aware of this situation) before the customer leaves us (approaching to leave) and then to take some preventive actions.
Telco churn data includes information about a fictitious telecom company that provided home phone and Internet services to 7,043 California customers in the third quarter. Which customers have left, stayed, or signed up for their service shows?
